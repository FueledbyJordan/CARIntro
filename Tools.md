## Hardware

### [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/)
#### Arduino is a platform that is used extensively by hobbyist roboticists.
#### In CAR, we use Arduino as the "brains" of each robot.  The Arduino typically controls sensors, motors, and other periphery devices.

### Peripheral Devices
#### These are devices that are connected to the controller of the robot.  Examples include motors, solenoids, cameras, and infrared sensors.
#### Common places that we get these devices are:
* [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/)
* [Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/)
##### All devices may not come from these sites.  It is important that you refer to the vendor's datasheet for further information.  This can be found by searching for the device name and model number.

### [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)
#### Raspberry Pi is a widely used single board computer.  These devices are used in education, robotics, automation, and Internet of Things.
#### In CAR, we use Raspberry Pi as a device that controls more complex peripheral devices.  An example is a live video feed that requires processing.
#### We will install Linux on almost all Raspberry Pis.

## Software

### [GDB](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/)
#### GDB is the GNU Project Debugger and is able to step through your C or C++ code one line at a time.  This is invaluable, as it allows you to test variables at each moment and will facilitate pinpointing bugs.
#### For more information on how to use GDB, go [here](http://darkdust.net/files/GDB%20Cheat%20Sheet.pdf).

### [GitHub](https://www.github.com)
#### GitHub is a software versioning control tool that allows users to contribute.
#### You will want to get an account set up on GitHub.
#### For information on how to use GitHub, go [here](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1).

### Linux
#### Linux is an operating system that is used commonly by software engineers.  It is used due to the amount of modifications that can be imparted upon it.
#### I suggest for Windows users to install a Linux partition on their hard drive.
#### I will assume you can use the GUI.  A tutorial on [how to use the command line](https://www.linuxtrainingacademy.com/linux-commands-cheat-sheet/) is provided.

### [PuTTy](http://www.putty.org/)
#### PuTTy is a SSH client.  CAR uses PuTTy as a tool to access and modify code on Raspberry Pis remotely.

### [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
#### Stack Overflow is a forum that connects software developers and allows them to share ideas, code snippets, and issues.
#### You will want to get an account set up on Stack Overflow.

### Text Editors
#### A text editor is the interface in which you will develop code for many projects.  This is a controversial topic.  For brevity, I will list the text editors that I use to develop software for CAR.
* [Atom](https://atom.io/)
* [Vim](http://www.vim.org/)
