### Programming
#### It is best practice to develop your algorithms before implementing them in a language.  In the case of robotics, software engineers are often limited on options due to preselected hardware.
#### If you run into an issue while working, the steps to take are as follows:
1. If compilation errors are present, follow the error stack.
2. If run time errors are present, use a debugger, such as [GDB](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/) if available.
3. If a conceptual issue arises, go to [Google](https://www.google.com/) and search for your issue.  The results may not be directly applicable to your situation; however, they may provide insight.
4. If 3 fails, ask a question to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).  Remember to include as much information as possible in your post.
5. If none of the aforementioned steps yield positive results, consult a more experienced member of the CAR team.

### C
#### C is a compiled language that was developed long ago.  It is used as a general purpose language.
#### In CAR we will use C to write low level software that may go on our control unit or a peripheral device.
#### Information on the syntax of C can be found [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_overview.htm).
#### Tutorials on the use of C can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGAKIXv8Yr6nhGJ9Vlcjyymq).

### C++
#### C++ is a compiled language that was developed as a superset of C.  It is more commonly used than C.
#### In CAR we will use C++ to write most of the code that will go on the control unit.
#### Information on the syntax of C++ can be found [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/).

### Python
#### Python is an interpreted language that was developed to facilitate the rapid development of software.  It is a high level language that is meant to be elegant and simple to read.
#### In CAR we will use Python as the language in which we develop on Raspberry Pis.
#### Information on the syntax of Python can be found [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/).
